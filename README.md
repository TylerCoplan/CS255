# CS255 - Portfolio of Work

These projects were for CS255 - systems analysis and design from Southern New Hampshire University

<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?</b>

This project was to implement an online system for a driver's education company.  The company wanted to have online testing and educational materials to complement their driver training courses and lessons.  They wanted the system to integrate with the current process at the physical location.  The design does a good job of using UML documentation to show different aspects of the system, such as use cases and activity diagrams for different use cases. 

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b?

I would revise the use case diagram to include login.  I thought this was so obvious it did not need documentation, but I was wrong.  All functionality, no matter how basic, should be included.

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>

I interpreted the user's needs through the interview with the business owner.  The owner described what he wanted users to be able to accomplish with the system.  I then thought about this from the user's viewpoint to determine what the user would expect from this system.  This is important to consider so the system is designed in a way that a user would find it easy to use.

<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b>

The JAD process sounds like a great way to analyze new system requirements.  It gets multiple parties with different views and specialties together to collaborate.  It can make others aware of issues/needs that they would not otherwise be aware of.  I like the UML diagrams because it visually shows how a process works.  These can be difficult and tedious to describe with words and the resulting explanation can be hard to follow.  Having standardized visuals means everyone involved should know how to interpret the diagram and can convey the same information much more simply.
